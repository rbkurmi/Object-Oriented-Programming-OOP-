Inheritance: This allows a new class (child) to inherit the attributes and methods of an existing class (parent).

Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class).
It restricts direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, usually through access modifiers like private or protected.

Polymorphism: It allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
Methods in different classes can have the same name but behave differently.

Abstraction: Hides the complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.
